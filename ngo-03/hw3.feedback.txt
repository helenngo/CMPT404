Helen,

Here is the breakdown of your grade and feedback by parts:

1.a) Pocket Algorithm starting at w=0

- Good experiments.


1.b) Linear Regression as classification

- Good experiments.


1.c) Pocket Algorithm starting with Linear Regression

- Good experiments.

Overall ver good. But you didn't do the grad student questions this time?

Peace,
- Dr. Rivas

Helen,

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 500 wasn't enough? -1pt

2) Excellent! 

3) Good picture/drawing. +5pts


Peace,

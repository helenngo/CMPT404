Helen,

You showed a nice proof that you have all the necessary setup for python.

You showed a nice proof that you have a GitHub account and that you added me as a
collaborator.

You provided a nice proof that you created a Kaggle account.

About the problems:
1. 
You have the correct answer and a good explanation.

2. 
You have a correct answer and a good explanation.

3.(a)
You have a very good explanation.
You provided Python code to support your answer.

3.(b)
You have the correct answer and a very good explanation.
You provided Python code to support your answer.

3.(c) 
You provided a correct answer and a good explanation.
You provided Python code to support your answer.
+1pt extra credit for answering a graduate student question.

4. Gaussian
The Gaussian distribution equation you provided is missing a $\sigma$ -1pt

4. Multivariate Gaussian
You provided the correct multivariate Gaussian formula.
Since we are dealing with vectors and matrices, and only if you want to show
that the multivariate and single variable Gaussian are different, you could use
$\mathbf{x}$ or $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ to indicate that they are a vector and a matrix
respectively.
I would use $P(X=x)$ rather than $f(x...)$, the P-notation is preferred.

4. Bernoulli
The formula you provided is correct.

4. Binomial
You provided the correct binomial distribution equation.
It is preferred to use $P(x; n, \pi)$ to indicate that n and $\pi$ are
parameters. The notation $P(x| n, \pi)$ usually indicates that x is conditioned
on the variables n and $\pi$. 
There seems to be a problem in one of your equations. 

4. Exponential
The equation you provided seems to have the main formula missing. -1pt

5.
You provided a very good explanation.
+1pt extra credit for answering a graduate student question.

6.
You have the correct answer and a good explanation.

7.(a)
You provided the correct answer.

7.(b)
The picture you provided is a little dark, but it is legible nonetheless.

8.(a)
You provided a correct answer and development of it.

8.(b)
You provided a good development and a correct answer.

8.(c)
You showed a good development of your correct answer.
There seems to be a problem in one of your equations, in the third line.

8.(d)
You have the correct answer and a good development of it.

About your $\LaTeX$ work:
- It seems like you put a lot of effort on it. 
- If this was your first time, you did great!
- Be careful when using thing like $M = \pi\ mathrm{e}^t$ because this will
  yield something you do not want; notice the space between \ and mathrm. You
  do not want that space. Instead, do $M = \pi \mathrm{e}^t$ which I think is
  what you want.

Overall a great job!

Peace,
